# Memory

This is a university project for the course "Agile Software Development for Enterprise".

It's an implementation of the famous game Memory. Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

In our version of the game, the winner is the player who finish first to uncover all pairs of cards.
